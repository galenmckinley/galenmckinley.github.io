Climate is changing due to human emissions of carbon to the atmosphere. But not all the carbon emitted remains there - in fact, over the industrial era, the ocean has absorbed excess carbon equivalent to 40% of all human fossil fuel emissions. Understanding the ocean and its role in the [global carbon cycle](https://galenmckinley.github.io/CarbonCycle/) is critical to understanding and predicting climate change.

The McKinley Ocean Carbon Research Group studies how ocean physical and biogeochemical processes impact large-scale carbon cycling and primary productivity. These studies encompass climate and ocean physics, biogeochemistry and ecology.  Our research tools include numerical models, oceanographic datasets, and machine learning. 

Current projects include
-	Building and applying ocean and Earth System models to understand carbon and oxygen processes
-	Developing explainable artificial intelligence methods to pinpoint drivers of Earth System Model biases 
-	Using model testbeds to address uncertainties and data gaps in machine learning products for air-sea CO2 fluxes, both globally and at the scale of potential mCDR 
-	Regularly [updating and disseminating](https://oceancarbon.ldeo.columbia.edu) state-of-the-art ocean carbon products for application in science and policy


Here's the group in December 2024

#### Ocean Carbon Resources
Please see our [LDEO Ocean Carbon](https://oceancarbon.ldeo.columbia.edu) site to download data products and code.

In 2024, we developed this [data story](https://stories.leap.carbonplan.org/ocean-sink) on the ocean carbon sink. Check out the cool animations created by [CarbonPlan](https://carbonplan.org).
