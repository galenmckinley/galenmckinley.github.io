Intro text about the McKinley Ocean Carbon Group 


### Current Research 

#### The changing ocean carbon sink
We use large databases of surface ocean pCO2 data to assess how the ocean carbon cycle is responding to the increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration (latest NOAA data for the atmosphere).

#### Earth System Models
We use the National Center for Atmospheric Researchâ€™s Community Earth System Model in Large Ensemble mode to understand how natural variability in the climate system impacts our ability to detect change in the ocean carbon sink. We are also using the CESM to study mechanisms of future change and uncertainty in carbon cycle projections.

#### North Atlantic
We have developed a North Atlantic regional coupled physical- ecosystem-carbon model  to investigate the impacts of physical variability on ecosystem-carbon cycle dynamics.

#### Great Lakes
We use numerical models to understand circulation, carbon cycling, lake-wide biogeochemistry, and CO2-induced acidification in the Great Lakes. We have published several papers on the carbon budget of Lake Superior and Lake Michigan. Publications currently in review address the biogeochemical impacts of the quagga mussel invasion in Lake Michigan.
