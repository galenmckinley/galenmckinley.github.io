I am pleased to announce a new grant on marine carbon dioxide removal (mCDR) from the NOAA NOPP and OAP programs, in collaboration with NSF Chemical Oceanography.  

[Thea Heimdal](https://galenmckinley.github.io/group/) and I will be subsampling a high resolution model to determine how much surface pCO2 data will be needed to build high-fidelity reconstructions of air-sea CO2 fluxes. Our first target is to determine how much data will be needed to validate the regional physical/biogeochemical models that will eventually be needed to verify additional carbon uptake due to mCDR.
