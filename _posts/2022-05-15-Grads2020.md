What a joy to finally be able to celebrate in full regalia the 2020 PhDs of Dr. Luke Gloege and Dr. Sean Ridge. After a long pandemic wait, it was a great reunion and celebration with family and friends! We went to the steps of Grant's Tomb to do our own hooding prior to the convocation on main campus.
