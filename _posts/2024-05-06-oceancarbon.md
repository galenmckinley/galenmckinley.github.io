In the past several years, the McKinley group has developed two machine learning methods to interpolate sparse [surface ocean fCO2 data from SOCAT](https://socat.info) to global coverage. 

- For fCO2-Residual (monthly 1982-2022), we set aside the temperature component of pCO2 prior to machine learning in order to focus the statistics on the more poorly constrained biological / physical component ([Bennington et al. 2022, JAMES](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2021MS002960)).
	
- In LDEO-HPD (monthly 1959-2022), we use hindcast ocean models as a prior, and use machine learning to correct them toward the data ([Gloege et al. 2022 JAMES](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1029/2021MS002620), and [Bennington et al. 2022, GRL](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2022GL098632)). We contribute this product annually to the [Global Carbon Budget](https://globalcarbonbudget.org) suite.

In collaboration with colleagues at NOAA, we have also developed a final version of the LDEO/Takahashi climatology of fCO2 and net air-sea CO2 flux [Fay et al. 2024](https://essd.copernicus.org/articles/16/2123/2024/).

To make these results easily available, we have developed a [new website](https://oceancarbon.ldeo.columbia.edu) that describes the data products in detail and that provides links to the data products and their source code. This site will be updated annually. 

Please check it out this [new site](https://oceancarbon.ldeo.columbia.edu) and bookmark it for future reference!
