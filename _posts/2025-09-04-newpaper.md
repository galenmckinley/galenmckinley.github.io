In this [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-025-02380-4), we discuss the impact of the unprecedented ocean warming of 2023 on the ocean carbon sink in the non-polar oceans (i.e. outside of the Arctic and Southern Ocean). Solubility reduces the sink very strongly, but physical / biogeochemical mechanisms act to increase the sink, with the net effect being a 10% reduction from what would be expected accounting for growing atmospheric pCO2 and an El Nino year. You can find a more extensive summary in this [press release](https://news.climate.columbia.edu/2025/09/04/the-ocean-carbon-sink-is-ailing/) from Columbia's Climate School.
