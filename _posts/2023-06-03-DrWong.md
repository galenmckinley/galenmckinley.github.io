Congratulations to Suki Wong for her successful PhD defense on May 30. 

Suki has worked to understand the ocean carbon cycle across scales from coastal to global, using in situ data, machine learning derived products and CMIP6 models. One paper on the representation of carbon fluxes due to ENSO in CMIP6 is [published](https://academiccommons.columbia.edu/doi/10.7916/b30q-be39), and another analyzing global-scale CO2 flux variability in our LDEO-HPD observation-based product is coming soon.
