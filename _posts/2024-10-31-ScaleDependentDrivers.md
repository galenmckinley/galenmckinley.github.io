I am happy to share a new paper, led by Amanda Fay, in which we show that at the global scale, recent air-sea CO2 flux variability is driven in equal proportions by the variable growth rate of atmospheric pCO2 and climate. However, as scales become smaller, climate increasingly is the dominant factor. 

A key implication here is that we must reduce uncertainty in the climate drivers components if we want to be able to detect the impact of emission mitigation on the ocean carbon sink.  


The paper is [here](http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2024GL111911).
