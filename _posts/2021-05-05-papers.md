In [Gloege et al. 2021, in Global Biogeochemical Cycles](http://doi.org/10.1029/2020GB006788), we use large ensembles of climate models as a testbed to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of a machine learning approach to extrapolate ocean pCO2 to global coverage, such that the ocean CO2 sink can be quantified and understood. We find very good representation for the long-term mean and seasonality, but more uncertainty in the representation of decadal variability. 

In [Ridge and McKinley, 2021, in Biogeosciences](https://bg.copernicus.org/articles/18/2711/2021/), we study the future response of the ocean carbon sink to a range of emission scenarios. Under all scenarios, the sink will become less efficient. If we do not mitigate, this efficiency decline will be due to reduced carbonate buffering capacity. If we do mitigate emissions consistent with a 1.5C target, the efficiency decline will be because the anthropogenic carbon currently stuck in the surface ocean will be partially reemitted to the atmosphere.
