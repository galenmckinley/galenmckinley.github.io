Galen is excited to announce that she's been elected Councilor for Chemical Oceanography at [The Oceanography Society](https://tos.org). I look forward to getting to know better this great grass-roots oceanography organization. Feel free to contact Galen (mckinley at ldeo.columbia.edu) with thoughts on how to improve TOS.
