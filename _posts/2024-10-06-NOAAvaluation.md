We are thrilled to announce new funding from NOAA. 

Our goal with our project "Valuation of Surface Ocean pCO2 Observations For Machine Learning Applications" is to quantify explicitly the value of each surface ocean pCO2 datapoint to machine learning reconstructions of the global ocean pCO2 field. Our research question is: How does value vary across the space-time distribution of existing and potential future pCO2 data? 

The announcement from NOAA is [here](https://oceanacidification.noaa.gov/noaa-oap-gomo-fund-3m-for-optimizing-ocean-carbon-observing/). 

Amanda, Thea and I, along with Viviana Acquaviva at CUNY and Columbia/LDEO and Tian Zheng at Columbia, are excited to get started on this work.
