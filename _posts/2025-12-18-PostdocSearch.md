The McKinley Ocean Carbon group is recruiting a Postdoctoral Research Scientist.

Air-sea CO2 and O2 exchange is vigorous and particularly critical to climate and ocean life in the high latitude North Atlantic. This is one of only a few places where deep-water formation occurs, moving waters rich in anthropogenic CO2 and O2 to the abyss, where they are sequestered for hundreds to thousands of years. Numerical simulations are essential scientific tools for understanding the interplay between short-term gas exchange and the long-term evolution of whole-ocean CO2 and O2 content. The McKinley Group has developed a state-of-the-art regional ocean simulation that applies data assimilation to optimize biogeochemical processes (ASTE-BGC) (Moseley et al. JAMES, in review). This postdoc will integrate existing bubble-mediated flux parameterization codes into the optimized ASTE-BGC, run ASTE-BGC, analyze impacts of these parameterizations on CO2 and O2 fluxes and budgets, and publish the results.
