Former PhD Student Luke Gloege is first author on a [new paper in JAMES](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1029/2021MS002620) from the McKinley Group. We use machine learning to reconstruct surface ocean pCO2. We take advantage of the physical / biogeochemical information provided by ocean hindcast models by taking them as a first guess of the solution. The algorithm then corrects the models toward the observations. 

There is also an open position for a [postdoc in the group](https://academic.careers.columbia.edu/#/90517). The appointee will continue in this thread of research. Please apply if you are interested. You can coontact Professor McKinley with questions.
