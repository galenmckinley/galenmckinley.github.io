Former PhD Student Luke Gloege is first author on a [new paper in JAMES](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1029/2021MS002620) from the McKinley Group. We use machine learning to reconstruct surface ocean pCO2 and then calculate CO2 fluxes monthly from 1982-2018. We make use of the physical / biogeochemical information provided by ocean hindcast models by taking them as a first guess for our solution. The algorithm then corrects these estimates to the observations. 

There is also an open position for a [postdoctoral researcher in the group](https://academic.careers.columbia.edu/#/90517). The appointee will further develop ML approaches for ocean carbon studies. Please apply using the link provided if you are interested. You can contact Professor McKinley with questions.
