Professor McKinley is accepting applications for a postdoctoral scholar to work on anthropogenic carbon fluxes and storage associated with the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation. We will evaluate CMIP6 simulations and collaborate with a large team analyzing observations at [RAPID](https://rapid.ac.uk) and [OSNAP](https://www.o-snap.org). Learn more about AMOC and carbon from this great [TED talk by Susan Lozier of GeorgiaTech](https://www.ted.com/talks/susan_lozier_is_climate_change_slowing_down_the_ocean).  

The postdoc will join the vibrant research communities at [Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory](https://lamont.columbia.edu), the [LEAP Science Technology Center](https://leap.columbia.edu), and across [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu).

For more information and complete application details, please go [here](https://academic.careers.columbia.edu/#!/134380). Review of applications will begin on April 1, 2024 and continue until the position is filled.
