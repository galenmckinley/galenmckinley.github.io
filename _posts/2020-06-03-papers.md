In AGU Advances, we show that the ocean carbon sink variability of the last several decades was externally forced by the atmospheric pCO2 growth rate and large volcanic eruptions. [doi: 10.1029/2019AV000149](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2019AV000149).  

There have been several highlights and press reports on this work, including: [EOS](https://eos.org/editor-highlights/eruption-and-emissions-take-credit-for-ocean-carbon-sink-changes),
[Nature Climate Change](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-020-0842-9),

In ERL, Luke Gloege led a paper to show that in-lake hydrodynamics allow for near-shore concentration of riverine pollutants and enhanced impacts on ecosystem services. [doi:10.1088/1748-9326/ab7f62](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ab7f62).
