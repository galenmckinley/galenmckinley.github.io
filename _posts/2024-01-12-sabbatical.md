Professor McKinley is on sabbatical at ETH-Zurich for January to May 2024. She is writing a book and working on ocean carbon research with the [Environmental Physics group, led by Niki Gruber](https://up.ethz.ch).  She is also a senior fellow of the [Collegium Helveticum](https://collegium.ethz.ch). 

Thanks everyone in the group and the Collegium for your warm welcome!

Here's a photo from a gray winter day in the first week.
