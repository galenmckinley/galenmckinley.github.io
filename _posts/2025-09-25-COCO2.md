We are very glad to announce that Professor McKinley will be co-leading, with [Adrienne Sutton of NOAA PMEL](https://www.pmel.noaa.gov/co2/story/Adrienne+J.+Sutton,+Ph.D.), a project in Schmidt Science's [Virtual Institute for the Carbon Cycle (VICC)](https://www.schmidtsciences.org/vicc/).

In this effort, we will deploy autonomous vehicles in the Southern Ocean winter to observe carbon and related variables. We will plan observations each year using Observing System Simulation Experiments (OSSEs). 

The data collected in COCO2 will be shared immediately via the [SOCAT](https://www.socat.info) database so that everyone can work with them to reduce critical uncertainties in the ocean carbon sink. 

On Constraining Ocean Carbon with Optimized Observing (COCO2), we also have amazing partners at [CSIR](https://www.csir.co.za) / [Stellenbosch University](https://www.sun.ac.za/english) in South Africa, including [Sandy Tomalla](https://www.csir.co.za/dr-sandy-thomalla); and at [CSIRO](https://research.csiro.au) in Australia, including [Elizabeth Shadwick[](https://people.csiro.au/S/E/Elizabeth-Shadwick).
