I am interested in how ocean physical and biogeochemical processes impact large-scale carbon cycling and primary productivity. Thus in the most general sense, we are interested in fluid and climate dynamics, biogeochemical processes and marine ecology. To answer our research questions, my group develops, runs and analyzes models and also analyzes large historical datasets.  

As of spring 2018, our primary research thrusts are (1) separating natural variability from anthropogenic change in the global ocean carbon sink, (2) using observations and climate models together to improve spatial mapping of air-sea CO2 fluxes, (3) understanding impacts on carbon uptake of growing Arctic freshwater export to the North Atlantic, and (4) developing an improved regional coupled physical-biogeochemical model of the Atlantic-Arctic system. 

### AMANDA FAY

Amanda Fay has been a research scientist in the McKinley group since 2011. She is currently on an Indian Ocean GO-SHIP cruise and will update this site when she returns. Her blog is here.

### Note to Prospective Students

I am glad to discuss graduate school opportunities with students interested in using quantitative methods to learn about coupled physical-biogeochemical processes in the oceans. Undergraduates interested in research are also welcome to contact me. This website is a great way for you to get an initial feel of the research we do and the approaches we use. Please give the site a good look and then contact me with you questions.
