Dr. Galen McKinley is Professor of Earth and Environmental Sciences at Columbia University and Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory. She is an ocean, carbon cycle and climate scientist.  She has additional expertise in the physics and biogeochemistry of Lakes Superior and Michigan. 

Prior to coming to Columbia in 2017, Galen was Professor of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences at University of Wisconsin - Madison (2004-2017). She received her PhD in Climate Physics and Chemistry from MIT in 2002, and her BS in Civil Engineering from Rice University in 1995. Her postdoctoral work was at Princeton University and the Instituto Nacional de Ecologia in Mexico.

### LAUREN MOSELEY 

Lauren Moseley will start in the McKinley group in Fall 2018. 

### Note to Prospective Students

I am glad to discuss graduate school opportunities with students interested in using quantitative methods to learn about ocean physical and biogeochemical processes, and the resulting impacts on the global carbon cycle. Undergraduates interested in research are also welcome to contact me. This website is a great way for you to get an initial feel of the research we do and the approaches we use. Please give the site a good look and then contact me with you questions.
