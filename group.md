Climate is changing due to human emissions of carbon to the atmosphere. But not all the carbon emitted remains there - in fact, over the industrial era, the ocean has absorbed excess carbon equivalent to 40% of human emissions. Thus, understanding the ocean carbon cycle is critical to understanding current and predicting future climate change.

My group studies how ocean physical and biogeochemical processes impact large-scale carbon cycling and primary productivity. These studies encompass fluid dynamics, climate processes, biogeochemistry and ecology.  To answer our research questions, my group develops, runs and analyzes numerical models and also analyzes large historical datasets.  

As of spring 2018, our primary research thrusts are (1) separating natural variability from anthropogenic change in the global ocean carbon sink, (2) using observations and climate models together to improve spatial mapping of air-sea CO2 fluxes, (3) understanding impacts on carbon uptake of growing Arctic freshwater export to the North Atlantic, and (4) developing an improved regional coupled physical-biogeochemical model of the Atlantic-Arctic system so that detailed mechanistic assessments of the North Atantic carbon sink can be made. 

### AMANDA FAY

Amanda Fay has been a research scientist in the McKinley group since 2011. She is currently on an Indian Ocean GO-SHIP cruise and will update this site when she returns. Her blog is here. 

### RAPHAEL DUSSIN

Raphael Dussin is a new addition to the McKinley group..

### LUCAS GLOEGE

Lucas Gloege is a 4th year PhD student in the McKinley group. 

### SEAN RIDGE

Sean Ridge is a 3rd year PhD student in the McKinley group. 

### LAUREN MOSELEY 

Lauren Moseley will start in the McKinley group in Fall 2018. 

### Note to Prospective Students

I am glad to discuss graduate school opportunities with students interested in using quantitative methods to learn about ocean physical and biogeochemical processes, and the resulting impacts on the global carbon cycle. Undergraduates interested in research are also welcome to contact me. This website is a great way for you to get an initial feel of the research we do and the approaches we use. Please give the site a good look and then contact me with you questions.
