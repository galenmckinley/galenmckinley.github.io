Check out our [new paper on North Atlantic chlorophyll trends](https://www.biogeosciences.net/15/6049/2018/), just published in Biogeosciences. 

The SeaWiFS satellite observed significant chlorophyll trends in the North Atlantic subpolar gyre over 1998-2007. Here, we use our MITgcm.NA model to untangle the complex mechanisms leading to these trends. In the east, reduction in horizontal nutrient flux convergence drove productivity declines. In the west, alleviation of light limitation due to shoaling mixed layers led to increased productivity. 

Hats off to all the authors for getting this one across the finish line! 

We thank NASA for supporting this study.
