The senior members of the McKinley group recently went to the [AGU Chapman Conference on Understanding Carbon Climate Feedbacks](https://connect.agu.org/aguchapmanconference/upcoming-chapmans/carbon-climate). We gave two talks and two posters, all of which were well-received and led to valuable discussions. It was a great chance to interact with the global carbon cycle community.
