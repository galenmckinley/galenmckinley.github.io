We are busy in the lab this summer. Luke has been analyzing pCO2 reconstructions with his Large Ensemble testbed; Amanda has been working up SOCATv6 data and thinking about forced trends in pCO2 and CO2 fluxes; and Sean has been finishing a paper on projected North Atlantic carbon sink changes due to freshwater fluxes out of the Arctic. Raphael has successfully set up our new local cluster "artemis" and has made great progress getting ASTE running and biogeochemistry implemented. Professor McKinley has been writing proposals and traveling - she is now glad to be back in the lab for most of August. We all look forward to welcoming Lauren Moseley to the lab in a few weeks. Summer is waning and we look forward to the excitement of the new academic year that will soon be upon us!
